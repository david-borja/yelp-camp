## What's about?

YelpCamp is a Yelp clone for camps, where camp owners can promote their camps and users can find their ideal place to relax and leave reviews.

## Tech

```js
const techUsed = {
  code: ["JavaScript"],
  frontEnd: ["HTML5", "CSS3", "EJS"],
  backEnd: ["Node.js", "Express.js"],
  database: ["MongoDB", "Mongoose"],
  authentication: "Passport",
  deployment: "Heroku"
}
```

## Next Steps

- Seed MongoDB Atlas with random camps in production (already done in development)
- Randomly assing each camp a picture from this <a href="https://unsplash.com/collections/429524/camping">Unsplash collection</a> 
- Adapt views to be mobile responsive
